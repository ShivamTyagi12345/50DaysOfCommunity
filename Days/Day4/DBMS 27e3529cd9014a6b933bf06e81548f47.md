- DBMS allows users to
    
      1. Create - create and new data to the database
    
      2. Read : retrieve data for different uses by the various applications 
    
      3. Update : Update data in real time
    
      4. Delete : Delete the unused data
    

# Advantages of DBMS

- **Data sharing:**
- **Easily Maintenance:**
- **Reduce development time:**
- **Backup:**

# Disadvantages of DBMS

- **High** **Cost of Hardware and Software:**
- **Size:**
- **Complexity:**

**Properties of  RDBMS**

**A means Atomicity:** This ensures the data operation will complete either with success or with failure. It follows the 'all or nothing' strategy. For example, a transaction will either be committed or will abort.

**C means Consistency:** If we perform any operation over the data, its value before and after the operation should be preserved. For example, the account balance before and after the transaction should be correct, i.e., it should remain conserved.

**I means Isolation:** There can be concurrent users for accessing data at the same time from the database. Thus, isolation between the data should remain isolated. For example, when multiple transactions occur at the same time, one transaction effects should not be visible to the other transactions in the database.

**D means Durability:** It ensures that once it completes the operation and commits the data, data changes should remain permanent.

**Notes**

Cardinality: no of enteries

Domaian: the set of possible values each entry  can have

data integrety :  ?

```jsx

```

| DBMS | RDBMS |
| --- | --- |
| stored as file system | tabular form |
| No security | ACID is followed |
| No normalization | yes |

**NOTE:** What is the difference between Dbms And File based system?

**DBMS architecture : 1 ,2 and 3 tier** 

• The overall design of a database is called schema.

**DATA INDEPENDENCE**

E-R Diagram

Entity: An entity may be any object, class, person or place.

Attribute : The variables that store various field values composing the entity

 

**KEYS**

Prime Attributes: The attributes that are a part of Key

Non Prime: Those who arent

![Untitled](DBMS%2027e3529cd9014a6b933bf06e81548f47/Untitled%201.png)

1. Primary:    Based on the requirements of the developers , a key that uniquely identifies an entry
2. candidate key:   Except for the primary key, the remaining attributes are considered a candidate key. 
3. Super Key :primary key + Some other attributes

### 3. Foreign key

- Foreign keys are the column of the table used to point to the primary key of another table.

OPERATIONS

# Join Operations:

[http://a4academics.com/blog/365-easy-way-to-remember-sql-joins](http://a4academics.com/blog/365-easy-way-to-remember-sql-joins)

Join row, if and only if a given join condition is satisfied. It is denoted by ⋈.

![Untitled](DBMS%2027e3529cd9014a6b933bf06e81548f47/Untitled%202.png)

Natural Join : Keeping rows that have common attributes

INTERFERENCE RULE

1. Reflective A→ B ie. B is a subset of A
2. Transitive A→ B and B→ C then A→C
3. Pseudo Transitive If X   →   Y and YZ   →   W then XZ   →   W
4. Union A→B and A→ C then A→BC
5. Decomposition AB→C then  A→C and B→ C
6. Augmentation A→ B then AC→BC

# What is Normalization?

- Normalization = decomposing table to avoid repeatations
- THIS solves to Insertion(agar isko students and Branch m divide kare , Toh bina student k  branch ko exist karna chahiye , thsat is not possible, Deletion - Deleting a branch will need to update it at multiple places and Updation= Lets say HOD changes will need to update it at multiple places, anamoly

1 NF: Relations right out of ER diagram

2 NF: 1 NF without Partial Dependency

first Normal form

1.  Table should not contain any multi-valued attribute

For example, In a table of student and the courses , a student cannot have 2 courses enrolled. If it does , it is not in First Normal form , and we need to break it down 

| Ram | C/C++ | 1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sita | java | 2 |

| Ram | C | 1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ram | C++ | 1 |
| Sita | Java | 2 |

OR, (this is not a good rep due to many null values)

| Ram | C | C++ | 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sita | Java | Null | 2 |

Third format is to use foreign key: Here Roll Number

| Ram | 1 |
| --- | --- |
| Sita | 2 |

| 1 | C |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | C++ |
| 2 | Java |

Closure Method: Finding all the candidate key

Candidate Key: The smallest key via which we can determine all other Attributes. 

A→B ,B→C   ⇒ A+ = {A,B,C}  A is candidate key

SuperKey: Add anything to Candidate key. It becomes Super Key

eg. AB, ABC

Prime Attributes: Those attributes that are used in the formation of candidate key. 

eg, CK= abc, then PA= {a,b,c}

Non Prime Attributes: Not used in the formation of CK.

Steps:

**A→B   BC→D  E→C D→A**

1. Group the attributes that arent present in the rhs of the given functional dependencies(here, **AE+ = {ABCDE}**)
2. To determine other  ck, we check all th relations that have either A /E  present in the RIGHT hand side , we then replace it(here, D has A , now confirm using **DE+={ABCDE} …. keep repeating**

Second Normal Form

1.Table should be in First Normal Form

2, There should be no Partial dependency

(A part of the ckey is determining a Non Prime attribute)

The following table is a table with Partial dependency

 

![Untitled](DBMS%2027e3529cd9014a6b933bf06e81548f47/Untitled%204.png)

Third Normal Form

1. table should be in second normal form
2. NonPrime Attribute cannot determine Another NonPrime Attribute (No Transitive depencency)

BCNF:

1. table should be in third normal form
2. Left hand side of each functional dependency should be Superkey

## Joins

1.Natural

![Untitled](DBMS%2027e3529cd9014a6b933bf06e81548f47/Untitled%205.png)

Select ename from emp naturalJoin Dept

Those values that are preseent in both the tables

**LEFT outer join:  Natural join + the one that are present in the left table**

**Right Outer Join : Natural Join + the one that are present in the right table**

**SQL**

why do we use  sql

To deal with structured data , i.e. that data that  is stored in tables

 

![Untitled](DBMS%2027e3529cd9014a6b933bf06e81548f47/Untitled%206.png)

  DDL:
**create** : create the table

**Alter** :

- Add a column
- delete a column
- change  datatype
- change size of entries (varchar (10) → varchar(20))
- rename column /table
- Add /remove Contraints i.e. Primary key, Foreign key etc

| Alter | Update |
| --- | --- |
| DDL | DML |
| structure changed | data changed |

| DELETE | Truncate | Drop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ddl | ddl | dml |
| Deletes entries - Slower | No logs created , deletes entire table- Faster  | Deletes entire table |
| eg, Delete (Rollback Possible) | eg. Shift + Delete ( No rollback ) |  (No roll back) |

in /not in: the innner query runs once

exist/ not exist: innneer query runs again n again

**CONFLICT Serializabilty**

No loop= conflict serizable= Consistent

![Untitled](DBMS%2027e3529cd9014a6b933bf06e81548f47/Untitled%207.png)

**Transaction :** Set of operations to perform a logical work . It usually represents a  change in a database

Active → Partially Commited(n-1 steps/ n ) → Committed (nth step) → Terminated

        👇🏻   → Failed  → Abort(kill / restart)————————————————   👆🏻

 

Schedule: How multiple transactions are carried out. two types are Serial and Parallel schedule

Throughput: No. of transactions/ time directly proportional to performance

**Write Read Conflict ( Dirty Read Problem)**

Dirty Read : When a transaction T1 fails but another parallel transaction T2 reads the changed value, instead of original .. That is called dirty read

Dirty Reads A dirty read **occurs when a transaction reads data that has not yet been committed**.

=====⇒ T1 fails and T2 carries wrong value

**Read Write Conflict ( Unrepeatable Read)**

 When another Transaction T2 starts and finishes  (Reads and Writes) while transaction T1 is still happening. This is called Read Write conflict

 ————> T2 starts and ends while  T1 is still going on

Recoverable and Irrecoverable schedule

Write Read Conflit

Cascading Schedule Vs Cascadeless schedule

    .Cascading

| T1 | T2 |
| --- | --- |
| R(A) |  |
| W(A) |  |
|  | R(A) |

Cascadeless

| T1 | T2 |
| --- | --- |
| R(A) |  |
| W(A) |  |
| Commit |  |
|  | R(A) |

**SERIALIZABILITY**

Find a clone of Parallel thats serial

two types are Conflict and View.
