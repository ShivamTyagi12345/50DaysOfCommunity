### How internet works

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled.png)

- The same computer can work as a server(localhost) and a client
- **Protocols**: The rules that define a transfer of information
- eg: Transfer control Protocol, Universal Datagram Protocol

### How do IP addresses work(Internet to Application)

Internet Service Provider(TATA etc) ‚Üí allocates IP to each modem/Router ‚Üí Using DHCP modem decides which device to connect to ‚Üí  Now using **Port number** the device decides which application to channel the request to.

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%201.png)

Total =2^16 ~ 65000 ports are available, now among these we have **Reserved Ports and User-available ports**

The internet is in the sea. Here‚Äôs an illustration of submarine cable spread across the continents

**Physical Connections: Op**tical Fibres

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%204.png)

**Wireless Connections:** Bluetooth, Wifi

The Internet is a collections of the following three catergorizations

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%205.png)

WAN had two things SoNET and Frame Relay

**Modem**: Converts digital to electrical Data

---

## Topologies

1. **Bus** A‚áíB‚áíC
2. **Ring** 

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%206.png)

1. **Star**

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%207.png)

1. **Tree** : Many many star connected as a bus
2. **Mesh: E**very single computer is connected to each other

## Structure of the Network

An analogy before we proceed on how we receive our order from Amazon 

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%208.png)

Now ,Open system Interconnection Model: Its the standard with which how servers connect to each other

**There are 7 layers:(PD- NT - SPA**)

Physical ‚áí Data Link ‚áí Network ‚áí Transport ‚áí Session ‚áí Presentation ‚áíApplication

*Presentation*: It uses SSL , and passes the data downwards 

*Session*: It creates a session and does authentication ,transferring data to Transport

*Transport*: The data from session has Port Number and  Session number, uses TCP(**sends the ENTIRE data eg. emails**) and UDP(**DATA Loss ,eg.Video calling**)

*Network* : From THIS layer, comes **ROUTER bund**les  

data and IP address and connects to other computer, Load Balancing also happening here

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%209.png)

*Data Link:* It adds Mac Addresses to the frame and then it can push that frame

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2010.png)

## TCP/IP Model

It has 5 layers

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2011.png)

---

1. **APPLICATION LAYER**

‚áí Users Interact

‚áí WhatsApp ,Browsers, etc

‚áí where: On the devices

‚áí Uses Protocols

A. Client server

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2012.png)

 B. Peer to peer

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2013.png)

**Note**:

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2017.png)

**C. PROTOCOLS**

web Protocols

- Http
- DHCP
- FTP(tile transfer protocol)
- SMTP
- POPS& IMAC
- SSH(secure shell)
- VNC(virtual network connection)
- Tellnet
- UDP (stateless connection)

**`Process and Thread:`**

 The process is like the running instance of a program  and thread is like the lighter version of a process

Difference: When a thread can only focus on one task at a time ,Process can focus on many

Eg. When using Wapp, we can record a video while sending a message

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2018.png)

 

`Sockets`

It‚Äôs a software process. Its the interface btw process and the Internet

`Ports`

IP address identify the computer (eg. Computer whose Browser made a request and Ports identify which process (eg. Tab in that browser) that made the request

`HTTP in details`

HTTP is a client-server protocol and it tells us how we request the server and how the response is sent to the sever

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2019.png)

 

- This is a stateless protocol: Server doesn‚Äôt store any info about the client using it. (_for ex: every time a client makes a new *click/request*  it treats as a new client request)
- Http is an application layer protocol that uses TCP

`Methods`: it tells the server what to do

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2020.png)

`Cookies:`

Now we saw that Http being stateless , (for eg. Amazon should log us out every time we refresh ,but it doesn‚Äôt happen: This happens through Cookies) Cookies attach themselves from the point when we use the URL for the very first time, And now every new request is checked against their cookies internally in the database of the website to restore the state. In our case Login)

`How Email Works`

PD-NT-SPA

1. Application Layer Protocol :  SMTP or POPS
2. Transport: TCP(coz we want full data and No Losses)

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2021.png)

üíØ`DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM)`

Http  converts the URL into an IP address and then connects to that server

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2022.png)

Root/top level domains:

They are the first point of connections

[Root Server Technical Operations Association](https://root-servers.org/)

**Spoiler** ü§îüî¥ Our ISP knows all the Websites we are visiting .It doesn‚Äôt matter if we are using Incognito‚≠ï
**6 simple Steps What happens when we lookup [google.co](http://google.co)m**

Here ISP means local DSP

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2024.png)

1. **TRANSPORT LAYER(located in our devices)**

 Its role is to take  the information from the  network to the Application

(eg. the computer received ‚Äúhey‚Äù now which application FB, wapp etc, to send to )   

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2025.png)

`Multiplexer and Demultipler`

Lets make up our minds to believe that we dont care how the data handled in ‚Äúair‚Äù .We just have a scenario where We are doing Facetime +Sending a text+ Sending a File to a friend

**Question *: We are sending data in bundles, how does our computer know which type of information to send to the network in their respective  network?***

**Answer: MULTIPLEXER AND DEMULTIPLEXR**

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2027.png)

- transport layer also takes care of Congestion control(Maintaining a balance between the Rate of Incoming data packets and sending them out)
- cong. control algorithms built in TCP

`Checksum:`

‚ÄúHi My Name is Shivam‚Äù‚áí Sent by sender

‚ÄúMy Hi Shivam is name‚Äù ‚áí Received

Just so that this doesn't happen we have checksum 

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2028.png)

`Timers:`

**How will I know that NO data is lost in the way**

If at any point Timer expires, we will know that the 

packet is lost.

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2029.png)

`User-Datagram Protocol`ü§© 

‚áí data may or may not be  delivered

‚áí Data may change

‚áí Data may not be in Order(Using Checksums that we learnt earlier *viz.*  used to check if there is any corruption in the data BUT it does not do anything about it)

‚áí UDP Packet 

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2030.png)

 ‚áí Use Cases:

- video conferencing apps
- Gaming
- We use it coz its  a lot faster

`Transport Control Protocol (TCP)`

‚áí Transport layer protocol,

‚áí Application layer sends lots of raw data ‚Üí TCP segments this data ‚Üí divide it into chunks‚Üí add Headers(It may also collect the data network layer)

‚áí Congestion control

‚áí Takes care of :

- When data doesn‚Äôt arrive
- Maintains the order of data

‚áí Features :

- Connection-oriented (first the connection needs to be established). Achieved *via*
- `3-WAY Handshake`
    
    Now as we looked previously in UDP Packet , we had 8bytess of header that included 
    
    ‚Üí Sender Port Number
    
    ‚Üí Length of data given
    
    ‚ÜíDestination Port No.
    
    ‚ÜíChecksum
    
    Here we have **2 additional: Sequence Number. and Acknowledgement Number.**
    
    **`ACK no= previous [SQ.No](http://SQ.No) +1`**
    
    ![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2031.png)
    

- Error control
- Congestion control
- Full duplex( A and B can send files simultaneously)

1. **[NETWORK](http://3.NETWORK) LAYER**

**Note:**

Important to note that In the *Transport layer* the data we have is in *Segments* and In the *Network* Layer, the data we have is in *Packets,* and in the *Datalink*  layer we have data as *Frames*

‚áí Here we work with Routers( i.e. Global connections)

Forwarding Table are made of numerous Routing Tables

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2033.png)

 ‚áí Going back to out example of IP address

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2034.png)

`Control Plane:`

‚áí Links ‚ÜíEdges

    Routers ‚Üí Nodes

‚áí Routing can be done in two ways:

   1. Static Routing ‚Üí Done manually

   2. Dynamic Routing‚Üí Uses Dijakstra‚Äôs and Bellman-Ford algo

`Intenet Protocol(IP)`

- IPv4 ‚Üí 32-bit numbers with 4 words each word containing 8 bits
- IPv6 ‚Üí 128 - bits
- **Subnet :** In the network access part of IP ,we call it a fancy term called ‚Äúsubnet‚Äù and the subnet helps to identify the ISP in hop-by-hop routing(Eg. Jio Network goes to jio traffic , Airtel to airtel )
- Class of IP addresses : A B C D E

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2035.png)

- **Subnet Masking :**

 the subnet mask will mask the Network part of the IP and will leave the Device part for us to access

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2036.png)

eg. for class E ‚Üí subnet equals

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2037.png)

There is also something  called Variable length Subnet mask‚Üí This means the number of bits occupied by subnet

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2038.png)

In the above eg. 24 bits is occupied by Subnet and the remaining are 32-24=8 bits  and they can be anything.

`Packets`

TTL: Time to limit limits the minimum time that can be spent by a packet hopping

![Untitled](Networking%20543a9d671936487387703ed2794df631/Untitled%2039.png)

`IPv6`

‚áí It is not Backward compatible

‚áí ISPs would have to shift , lot of hardware work

‚áí 2^128 possible IP addresses in this
